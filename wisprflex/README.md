# WisprFlex Application

> 📋 **Placeholder Directory**

This directory will contain the WisprFlex application layer.

## Current Status

**Intentionally empty** during the engine open-source phase.

The engine is released first to:
- Validate the core library independently
- Allow community contributions to the engine
- Establish clear boundaries between library and app

## What Will Go Here

- Electron application (or Tauri in future)
- UI components
- Settings management
- Clipboard integration

## For Contributors

If you're looking to contribute:
- Start with the [engine](../engine/) directory
- See [PUBLIC_OVERVIEW.md](../docs/PUBLIC_OVERVIEW.md) for orientation
- The application layer will be added after engine stabilization
